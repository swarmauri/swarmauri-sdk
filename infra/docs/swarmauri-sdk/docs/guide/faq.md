    pip install git+https://github.com/swarmauri/swarmauri-sdk.git
    ```

For detailed installation instructions, refer to our Installation Guide.

### What are the system requirements for Swarmauri SDK?

- Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
- Package installer (pip or uv)
- Internet connection for downloading packages

### How do I get started with Swarmauri SDK?

Start by following the [Usage Guide](usage.md) for basic examples.

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Import Errors

If you encounter `ModuleNotFoundError`:

```bash
# Ensure Swarmauri SDK is installed
pip list | grep swarmauri
```

!!! warning "Common Import Error Causes" - Package not installed correctly - Virtual environment not activated - Package installed in a different Python environment - Package name misspelled in the import statement

### Version Conflicts

If you face dependency conflicts:

```bash
# Create a fresh virtual environment
python -m venv fresh-env
source fresh-env/bin/activate

# or fresh-env\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install swarmauri
```

!!! tip "Dependency Isolation"
Consider using tools like Poetry or pipenv for better dependency management. These tools create lockfiles that ensure consistent environments across different machines.

    ```bash
    # Using Poetry
    poetry add swarmauri

    # Using pipenv
    pipenv install swarmauri
    ```

### Installation Fails

If installation fails with build errors:

```bash
# Install build tools
# On Windows:
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel

# On macOS/Linux:
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
sudo apt install build-essential  # For Ubuntu/Debian
```

??? danger "Installation Troubleshooting"
If you encounter persistent installation issues:

    1. Make sure your pip is up to date: `pip install --upgrade pip`
    2. Check if you have sufficient privileges (try using `sudo` on Linux/Mac or run as administrator on Windows)
    3. If you're behind a corporate firewall, you may need to configure pip to use an HTTPS proxy
    4. For C extension errors, ensure you have the appropriate compilers installed

## Usage Clarifications

### How do I use tools in Swarmauri SDK?

Swarmauri SDK allows you to integrate various tools to enhance the capabilities of your AI models.

```python
from swarmauri.tools.JSONRequestsTool import JSONRequestsTool
from swarmauri.tools.CalculatorTool import CalculatorTool
from swarmauri.tool_llms.OpenAIToolModel import OpenAIToolModel
from swarmauri.toolkit.Toolkit import Toolkit
from swarmauri.conversations.Conversation import Conversation
from swarmauri.messages.HumanMessage import HumanMessage
from swarmauri.messages.SystemMessage import SystemMessage
import os
# Create a conversation with a system message
conversation = Conversation()
conversation.add_message(SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant with access to tools."))

# Create a toolkit with a calculator
toolkit = Toolkit()
toolkit.add_tool(CalculatorTool())

# Initialize an LLM with tool capabilities
llm = OpenAIToolModel(model="gpt-4-turbo")

# Create a tool agent
agent = ToolAgent(conversation=conversation, llm=llm, toolkit=toolkit)

# Example usage
response = agent.exec("What is 25 * 16?")
print(response)

# Continue the conversation with another tool-based query
response = agent.exec("What is the square root of 144?")
print(response)
```

!!! info "Available Tools"
Swarmauri SDK offers a variety of built-in tools including:

    - `CalculatorTool`: For mathematical operations
    - `RequestsTool`: For HTTP requests
    - `CodeExtractorTool`: For code extraction
    - `CodeInterpreterTool`: For python code execution

    You can also create custom tools by extending the `ToolBase` class.

### How do I create an AI assistant?

Create a simple AI assistant that can handle conversations:

```python
from swarmauri import SimpleConversationAgent, Conversation, SystemMessage, OpenAIModel

# Create a conversation with a system message
conversation = Conversation()
conversation.add_message(SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."))

# Initialize an LLM
llm = OpenAIModel(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Create a simple conversation agent
agent = SimpleConversationAgent(conversation=conversation, llm=llm)

# Example usage
response = agent.exec("What is machine learning?")
print(response)

# Continue the conversation
response = agent.exec("Can you explain it in simpler terms?")
print(response)
```

### How do I handle large datasets?

- **Chunking**: Break down large datasets into smaller chunks for processing.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize parallel processing to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Vector Stores**: Use vector stores for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.

```python
from swarmauri.agents.RagAgent import RagAgent
from swarmauri.llms.OpenAIModel import OpenAIModel
from swarmauri.documents.Document import Document
from swarmauri.conversations.Conversation import Conversation
from swarmauri.vector_stores.TfidfVectorStore import TfidfVectorStore
import os

# Create documents
documents = [
    Document(content="Paris is the capital of France."),
    Document(content="Berlin is the capital of Germany."),
    Document(content="Rome is the capital of Italy.")
]

# Initialize TfidfVectorStore
vector_store = TfidfVectorStore()

# Add documents to the vector store
vector_store.add_documents(documents)

# Create a conversation
conversation = Conversation()

# Create a RAG agent
agent = RagAgent(
    llm=OpenAIModel(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")),
    vector_store=vector_store,
    conversation=conversation
)

# Ask a question
answer = agent.exec("What is the capital of France?")
print(answer)
```

## Performance Optimization

### How can I optimize the performance of my Swarmauri application?

- **Use Efficient Models**: Choose models that balance performance and accuracy for your use case.
- **Batch Processing**: Process data in batches to reduce overhead.
- **Caching**: Implement caching for repeated computations.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Use asynchronous operations to improve responsiveness.
