# Why Use Swarmauri

## Overview

Swarmauri SDK is a comprehensive and modular toolkit for building AI-powered applications that require seamless integration of multiple models, tools, and services. Whether you're building a simple chatbot or a complex AI agent system, Swarmauri provides the building blocks to accelerate your development while maintaining flexibility and control.

!!! info "What is Swarmauri?"
    Swarmauri is an SDK designed to simplify AI application development by providing a unified interface to various AI models and tools. It emphasizes type safety, modularity, and production readiness.

## Core Advantages

### Modular Architecture

Swarmauri is built on a highly modular architecture that allows you to use only what you need. Each component can be used independently or combined with others, making it easy to start small and scale up as your requirements grow.

### Unified API

Work with different AI models, embeddings, and tools through a consistent interface. Whether you're using OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, or open-source models, the API remains the same, allowing you to switch providers without changing your application code.

!!! tip "Provider Switching"
    With Swarmauri's unified API, switching between model providers is as simple as changing a single parameter:

    ```python
    # Using OpenAI
    llm = OpenAIModel(model="gpt-4-turbo")

    # Switch to Anthropic
    llm = AnthropicModel(model="claude-3-opus")

    # The rest of your code remains unchanged!
    ```

### Type Safety

Built with Python's type system and leveraging Pydantic, Swarmauri provides excellent IDE auto-completion, static analysis, and runtime validation, significantly reducing bugs and improving developer productivity.

### Production Ready

Swarmauri is designed for production environments with robust error handling, retry mechanisms, rate limiting, and other features that ensure reliability in real-world applications.

### Agent Framework

Create sophisticated AI agents that can:

- Understand complex instructions
- Use tools to accomplish tasks
- Maintain context across multiple interactions
- Collaborate with other agents

## Common Use Cases

### Basic Conversational AI

Build simple chatbots that can engage in natural conversations with users.

```python
from swarmauri.agents.SimpleConversationAgent import SimpleConversationAgent
from swarmauri.conversations.Conversation import Conversation
from swarmauri.messages.SystemMessage import SystemMessage
from swarmauri.llms.OpenAIModel import OpenAIModel

# Create a conversation with a system message
conversation = Conversation()
conversation.add_message(SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."))

# Initialize an LLM
llm = OpenAIModel(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Create a simple conversation agent
agent = SimpleConversationAgent(conversation=conversation, llm=llm)

# Example usage
response = agent.exec("What is machine learning?")
print(response)

# Continue the conversation
response = agent.exec("Can you explain it in simpler terms?")
print(response)
```

!!! example "Use Case: Customer Support Bot"
    This pattern can be used to create customer support chatbots that can answer common questions, guide users through troubleshooting steps, and escalate to human agents when necessary.

### Tool-Augmented Assistants

Create assistants that can use tools to perform calculations, fetch information, and more.

```python
from swarmauri.agents.ToolAgent import ToolAgent
from swarmauri.conversations.Conversation import Conversation
from swarmauri.messages.SystemMessage import SystemMessage
from swarmauri.tool_llms.OpenAIToolModel import OpenAIToolModel
from swarmauri.tools.CalculatorTool import CalculatorTool
from swarmauri.toolkits.Toolkit import Toolkit

# Create a conversation
conversation = Conversation()

# Create a toolkit with various tools
toolkit = Toolkit(
    tools=[
        CalculatorTool(),
        RequestsTool()
    ]
)

# Create an agent with tools
agent = ToolAgent(
    llm=OpenAIToolModel(model="gpt-4-turbo"),
    toolkit=toolkit,
    conversation=conversation
)

# Ask the agent to perform a task
response = agent.exec("Calculate 25 * 16 and then fetch information about the weather in New York.")
print(response)
```

### Question Answering with RAG

Build systems that can answer questions based on your own documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

```python
from swarmauri.agents.RagAgent import RagAgent
from swarmauri.llms.OpenAIModel import OpenAIModel
from swarmauri.documents.Document import Document
from swarmauri.conversations.Conversation import Conversation
from swarmauri.vector_stores.TfidfVectorStore import TfidfVectorStore
import os

# Create documents
documents = [
    Document(content="Paris is the capital of France."),
    Document(content="Berlin is the capital of Germany."),
    Document(content="Rome is the capital of Italy.")
]

# Initialize TfidfVectorStore
vector_store = TfidfVectorStore()

# Add documents to the vector store
vector_store.add_documents(documents)

# Create a conversation
conversation = Conversation()

# Create a RAG agent
agent = RagAgent(
    llm=OpenAIModel(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")),
    vector_store=vector_store,
    conversation=conversation
)

# Ask a question
answer = agent.exec("What is the capital of France?")
print(answer)
```

### Document Processing

Process and analyze documents to extract insights and make them searchable.

```python
from swarmauri.documents.Document import Document
from swarmauri.chunkers.SentenceChunker import SentenceChunker
from swarmauri_vectorstore_mlm.MlmVectorStore import MlmVectorStore  # Import from community package

# Create a document
document = Document(content="""
Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by humans or other animals.
AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, understanding human speech, self-driving cars,
automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems.
""")

# Split the document into chunks by sentences
# This creates more natural chunks based on sentence boundaries
chunker = SentenceChunker()
chunks = chunker.split_document(document)

# Initialize MlmVectorStore
# This vector store uses masked language model embeddings
vector_store = MlmVectorStore()

# Add documents to the vector store
# MlmVectorStore will automatically calculate embeddings using a masked language model
vector_store.add_documents(chunks)

# Search for relevant information
results = vector_store.retrieve(query="What are examples of AI applications?", top_k=2)
for doc in results:
    print(doc.content)
```

!!! tip "Using Different Chunkers"
    Swarmauri offers various specialized chunkers for different document types:

    ```python
    from swarmauri.documents.Document import Document
    from swarmauri.chunkers.MdSnippetChunker import MdSnippetChunker
    from swarmauri_vectorstore_mlm.MlmVectorStore import MlmVectorStore

    # Create a markdown document
    markdown_doc = Document(content="""
    # AI Applications

    ## Web Search
    Modern search engines use AI to understand queries and rank results.

    ## Self-Driving Cars
    Autonomous vehicles use AI for perception, decision-making, and control.

    ## Natural Language Processing
    AI systems can understand and generate human language.
    """)

    # Use a specialized chunker for markdown documents
    # This preserves the structure of markdown headings and sections
    md_chunker = MdSnippetChunker()
    md_chunks = md_chunker.split_document(markdown_doc)

    # Process the chunks as before
    vector_store = MlmVectorStore()
    vector_store.add_documents(md_chunks)

    # Search for specific markdown sections
    results = vector_store.retrieve(query="Tell me about self-driving cars", top_k=1)
    for doc in results:
        print(doc.content)
    ```
