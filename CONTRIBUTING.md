### Developing Swarmauri Packages and Plugins

Swarmauri follows a plugin-based architecture where components can be added via Python's entry point system. Understanding this system is essential for developing new packages.

#### Package Development Setup

1. **Minimal Development Environment:**
   
   For developing a new Swarmauri package, you typically only need to install the core dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Using pip
   pip install -e pkgs/core/
   pip install -e pkgs/base/
   pip install -e pkgs/swarmauri_standard/
   
   # Or using uv (faster)
   uv pip install -e pkgs/core/
   uv pip install -e pkgs/base/
   uv pip install -e pkgs/swarmauri_standard/
   ```
2. **Package Structure:**

A typical Swarmauri plugin package should follow this structure:
```
swarmauri_<resource_kind>_<plugin_name>/
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
├── swarmauri_<resource_kind>_<plugin_name>/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── <PluginName>.py
└── tests/
    └── unit/
        └── <PluginName>_test.py
```

3. **Entry Point Registration:**

Swarmauri uses Python's entry points for plugin discovery. In your pyproject.toml, register your plugin:

```toml
[project.entry-points.'swarmauri.<resource_kind>']
<plugin_name> = "swarmauri_<resource_kind>_<plugin_name>:<PluginClass>"
```
For example, for a vector store plugin:

```toml
[project.entry-points.'swarmauri.vectorstores']
PineconeVectorStore = "swarmauri_vectorstore_pinecone:PineconeVectorStore"
```

**Plugin Citizenship Classes**

Swarmauri has a concept of "citizenship" for plugins, which determines their privileges:

1. **First-Class Plugins:**

    - Pre-registered and maintained by the core team
    - Must implement required interfaces
    - Example: `@ComponentBase.register_type(VectorStoreBase, "PineconeVectorStore")`

2. **Second-Class Plugins:**

    - Community-contributed plugins
    - Must implement the same interfaces as first-class plugins
    - Registered with the same namespace (e.g., swarmauri.vectorstores)

3. **Third-Class Plugins:**

    - Generic plugins with fewer restrictions
    - Registered under swarmauri.plugins namespace
    - Not required to implement specific interfaces

### Creating a New Plugin
1. **Subclass the Appropriate Base Class:**
```python
from swarmauri_base.ComponentBase import ComponentBase
from swarmauri_base.vectorstores.VectorStoreBase import VectorStoreBase

@ComponentBase.register_type(VectorStoreBase, "MyVectorStore")
class MyVectorStore(VectorStoreBase):
    """
    My custom vector store implementation.
    """
    type: Literal["MyVectorStore"] = "MyVectorStore"
    
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        # Your initialization code

    # Implement required methods from VectorStoreBase
```
2. **Configure Entry Point in pyproject.toml:**
```toml
[project]
name = "swarmauri_vectorstore_myvectorstore"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "My custom vector store for Swarmauri"
license = "Apache-2.0"
authors = [{ name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@example.com" }]
dependencies = [
    "swarmauri_core",
    "swarmauri_base",
    "swarmauri_standard"
]

[project.entry-points.'swarmauri.vectorstores']
MyVectorStore = "swarmauri_vectorstore_myvectorstore:MyVectorStore"
```
4. **Test Your Plugin:**
```sh
# Install your package in development mode
pip install -e path/to/swarmauri_vectorstore_myvectorstore

# Run unit tests
pytest swarmauri_vectorstore_myvectorstore/tests
```

**Accessing Your Plugin**

After registration, your plugin can be accessed in two ways:

1. **Via Namespace (Recommended):**
```python
from swarmauri.vectorstores import MyVectorStore

my_store = MyVectorStore()
```
2. **Direct Package Import:**

```python
from swarmauri_vectorstore_myvectorstore import MyVectorStore

my_store = MyVectorStore()
```

### Development Setup

1. **Run Tests with GitHub Actions:**
   - GitHub Actions will automatically run tests for your changes. 
   - Check the Actions tab to verify if your changes pass the tests.

2. **Enabling GitHub Actions on Your Fork:**
   - **Check for Workflow Files:** Ensure `.yml` workflow files are present under `.github/workflows` in your fork.
   - **Enable Actions:** 
     - Go to the "**Settings**" tab of your fork.
     - Under "**Actions**" in the left sidebar, ensure Actions are enabled. If not, enable them.
