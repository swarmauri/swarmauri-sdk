# Swarmauri Toolkit Jupytertoolkit

A unified toolkit for aggregating standalone jupyter notebook tools.

## Installation

To install `swarmauri_toolkit_jupytertoolkit`, run the following command:

```bash
pip install swarmauri_toolkit_jupytertoolkit
```

## Usage

To use `swarmauri_toolkit_jupytertoolkit`, you can import it into your Python script or Jupyter Notebook:

```python
from swarmauri_toolkit_jupytertoolkit import JupyterToolkit
```

You can then create an instance of the `JupyterToolkit` class:

```python
toolkit = JupyterToolkit()
```

The `JupyterToolkit` class provides a centralized management system for all integrated tools. You can add and remove tools from the toolkit using the `add_tool` and `remove_tool` methods:

```python
toolkit.add_tool("JupyterClearOutputTool")
toolkit.remove_tool("JupyterClearOutputTool")
```

You can also configure and customize tool settings using the `configure_tool` method:

```python
toolkit.configure_tool("JupyterClearOutputTool", {"option": "value"})
```

The `JupyterToolkit` class also provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for accessing and using integrated tools. You can access the interface by calling the `display` method:

```python
toolkit.display()
```

This will display the toolkit interface in the Jupyter Notebook.
