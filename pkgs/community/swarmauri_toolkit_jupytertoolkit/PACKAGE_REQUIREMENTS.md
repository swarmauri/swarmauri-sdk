# Jupyter Toolkit Project Requirements
=====================================================

## Purpose
--------

This document outlines the project-wide functional and non-functional requirements for the Jupyter Toolkit project.

## Description
-----------

The Jupyter Toolkit project aims to create a unified toolkit for aggregating standalone Jupyter notebook tools. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for the project.

## Functional Requirements
-------------------------

### 1. Toolkit Integration

* The toolkit shall integrate multiple standalone Jupyter notebook tools into a single, unified interface.
* The toolkit shall provide a mechanism for adding and removing tools from the interface.

### 2. Tool Management

* The toolkit shall provide a centralized management system for all integrated tools.
* The toolkit shall allow users to configure and customize tool settings.

### 3. User Interface

* The toolkit shall provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for accessing and using integrated tools.
* The toolkit shall support multiple interface themes and layouts.

### 4. Nested Tools

* The toolkit shall allow tools to be nested within each other.
* The toolkit shall provide a mechanism for managing and navigating nested tools.

## Non-Functional Requirements
------------------------------

### 1. Performance

* The toolkit shall respond to user input within 2 seconds.
* The toolkit shall be able to handle a minimum of 10 concurrent users.

### 2. Security

* The toolkit shall implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to integrated tools.
* The toolkit shall encrypt all data transmitted between the client and server.

### 3. Usability

* The toolkit shall provide clear and concise documentation for users and developers.
* The toolkit shall follow accessibility guidelines to ensure usability for users with disabilities.

## Constraints
--------------

* The toolkit shall be built using Python and Jupyter Notebook technologies.
* The toolkit shall be compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Assumptions and Dependencies
------------------------------

* The toolkit assumes that all integrated tools are compatible with the Jupyter Notebook framework.
* The toolkit depends on the Jupyter Notebook framework and its dependencies.
