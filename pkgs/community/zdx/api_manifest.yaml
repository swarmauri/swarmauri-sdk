# API manifest template for zdx
#
# Configure a list of `targets` to control which Python packages are documented.
# Each target becomes a section under `docs/api/<name>/` and is added to the
# MkDocs navigation.
#
# If your documentation pulls code from a uv workspace (such as this monorepo),
# add a ``workspace`` entry so ``zdx install`` performs a single ``uv pip
# install`` against the workspace root instead of installing each package
# individually. Example:
#
# workspace:
#   pyproject: ../../pyproject.toml

targets:
  - name: Example  # Navigation label and output folder name
    search_path: /pkgs/example  # Directory containing the source package(s)
    package: example_pkg  # Root import name when documenting a single package
    # discover: true  # Uncomment to automatically include all packages under search_path
    include:
      - example_pkg.*  # Glob patterns of modules to document
    exclude:
      - "*.tests.*"  # Glob patterns of modules to skip
