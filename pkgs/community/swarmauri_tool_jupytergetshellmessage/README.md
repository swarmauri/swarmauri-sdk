# Swarmauri Tool Jupyter Get Shell Message

A dedicated Python package providing a tool to retrieve shell messages from a running Jupyter kernel using jupyter_client. Built on the swarmauri framework, JupyterGetShellMessageTool is suitable for debugging, logging, and diagnostic purposes.

---

## Installation

To install this package from PyPI, use the following command:

    pip install swarmauri_tool_jupytergetshellmessage

If you are using Poetry for dependency management, add it to your project by specifying the package name in your pyproject.toml under [tool.poetry.dependencies]:

    [tool.poetry.dependencies]
    swarmauri_tool_jupytergetshellmessage = "^0.1.0.dev1"

Once installed, the package automatically brings in its required dependencies:
• swarmauri_core  
• swarmauri_base  
• jupyter_client  

No specialized steps beyond a standard Python environment with pip or Poetry are necessary.

---

## Usage

Below is a simple example illustrating how to retrieve shell messages from a currently running Jupyter kernel. Make sure you have an active Jupyter kernel in the environment you are running this code from (for instance, a notebook server launched via "jupyter notebook" or "jupyter lab").

1. Import JupyterGetShellMessageTool:

    from swarmauri_tool_jupytergetshellmessage import JupyterGetShellMessageTool

2. Instantiate the tool and call it:

    tool = JupyterGetShellMessageTool()
    result = tool(timeout=10.0)  # Wait up to 10 seconds for shell messages

3. Inspect the result:

    if "messages" in result:
        for msg in result["messages"]:
            print("Shell Message:", msg)
    else:
        print("No messages or error:", result.get("error", "No details"))

The tool attempts to connect to the active Jupyter kernel, retrieve available shell messages, and return them in a structured dictionary. If no messages are found within the specified timeout, it returns an error message indicating the timeout event.

---

## Dependencies

• swarmauri_core and swarmauri_base provide the core classes (ComponentBase, ToolBase) for building and integrating tools across the swarmauri ecosystem.  
• jupyter_client is leveraged to interface with the running Jupyter kernel, enabling retrieval of shell-based IPC messages.  

These dependencies are automatically installed when installing this package via pip or Poetry.
