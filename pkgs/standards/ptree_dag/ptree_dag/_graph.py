graph.py

This module provides functions to build and process a dependency graph from file records.
It includes functions to:
  - Build the forward dependency graph and compute in-degree counts.
  - Perform topological sorting on file records.
  - Find a start node in the sorted records based on provided selection parameters.
  - Process nodes from the identified start node onward.

Each file record is expected to have a unique identifier in the key "RENDERED_FILE_NAME"
and a list of resolved dependency identifiers in "RENDERED_DEPENDENCIES".
