I need you to generate a file named "{{ RENDERED_FILE_NAME }}". This file provides part of the implementation for the "{{ PKG.NAME }}" package.

Below are the details and requirements for this task:

1. **Purpose**:
   {{ FILE_CONTEXT.PURPOSE }}

2. **Description**:
   {{ FILE_CONTEXT.DESCRIPTION }}

3. **Requirements / Constraints**:
   {%- for requirement in FILE_CONTEXT.REQUIREMENTS %}
   - {{ requirement }}
   {%- endfor %}


4. **Style Guide**:
   - The code follows PEP 8 style guidelines.
   - All modules, functions, classes, and methods must include spacy styled docstrings.
   - The code follows PEP 484 annotation guidelines.
   - Critical sections of the code include comments explaining the logic.
   - Assume the user will copy-paste this code as-is into their project.

5. **File and Code Preferences**:
   - Provide the concrete fully functional implementation of the code.
   - All methods must feature a complete implementation.
   - Must inherit the base class.
   - Must provide fully functional implementations for all required methods.
   - Implement logging using logging.

### Desired Output
Produce a single code snippet that contains the entire content for the file {{ RENDERED_FILE_NAME }}. 
Do not wrap it in triple backticks! Just provide the raw code ready to copy-paste.
Do not provide an explanation afterward.

{# At the bottom of the template, include any example files specified by the EXAMPLES array #}
{% if FILE_CONTEXT.EXAMPLES %}
#### 
Leverage the reference file below as a guideline to utilize when creating the new component.

{%- for example in FILE_CONTEXT.EXAMPLES %}
#### Reference File: `{{ example }}`
```
{% include example %}

```
{%- endfor %}
{% endif %}
 
### Example Format of the Output
<!-- Example only; your code will vary. This is to show how your response should look. -->
{% include FILE_NAME %}

{# At the bottom of the template, include any dependency files specified by the DEPENDENCIES array #}
{% if DEPENDENCIES %}
### Dependencies
{%- for dependency in DEPENDENCIES %}
#### `{{ dependency | replace(PROJECT.PROJECT_ROOT + '/', '') }}`
```
{% include dependency %}

```

{%- endfor %}
{% endif %}
