"""
Placeholder module for nested CRUD operations.

This module will be developed in the future to support nested resource paths
and more complex CRUD operations with hierarchical data structures.

Examples of future functionality:
- /users/{user_id}/posts/{post_id}/comments
- /organizations/{org_id}/teams/{team_id}/members
- Complex resource relationships and nested operations
