    Implementation of the IDistanceSimiliarity interface using the Minkowski distance metric.
    Minkowski distance is a generalized metric form that includes Euclidean distance,
    Manhattan distance, and others depending on the order (p) parameter.

    The class provides methods to compute the Minkowski distance between two vectors.

    Parameters:
    - p (int): The order of the Minkowski distance. p=2 corresponds to the Euclidean distance,
               while p=1 corresponds to the Manhattan distance. Default is
