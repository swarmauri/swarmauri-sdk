"""Utilities for OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps (RFC 8252).

This module provides helpers to validate redirect URIs as required by
RFC 8252. Native applications are restricted to using either private-use
URI schemes or the loopback interface with an HTTP(S) scheme and a
dynamically chosen port. Redirect URIs that fall outside of these
patterns are considered non-compliant. Enforcement of these rules can be
toggled via ``runtime_cfg.Settings.enforce_rfc8252`` which is controlled
by the ``AUTO_AUTHN_ENFORCE_RFC8252`` environment variable.

See RFC 8252: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252
