    ``py_type`` denotes the expected Python type and may be omitted when the
    model attribute is annotated; the type will then be inferred. ``constraints``
    mirrors arguments accepted by :func:`pydantic.Field` and participates in
    schema generation. ``required_in`` and ``allow_null_in`` govern which API
    verbs must supply the value or may explicitly send ``null`` in requests.
