"""
Tigrbl v3 â€“ REST transport wrapper.

Use this when you prefer to mount a single top-level router that aggregates all
model routers (instead of mounting each one inside include_model).

Typical usage:
    from tigrbl.v3.transport.rest import build_rest_router, mount_rest

    # When including models, skip mounting per-model:
    api.include_model(User, mount_router=False)
    api.include_model(Team, mount_router=False)

    # Then aggregate & mount once:
    app.include_router(build_rest_router(api, base_prefix="/api"))
    # or:
    mount_rest(api, app, base_prefix="/api")
