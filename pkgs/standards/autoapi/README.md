# AutoAPI

A high-leverage meta-framework that turns plain SQLAlchemy models into a fully-featured REST+RPC surface with near zero boiler plate.

## Terminology

- **Tenant** – a namespace used to group related resources.
- **Principal** – an owner of resources, such as an individual user or an organization.

## Features
- Unified invocation 
- Automated REST & RPC symmetry and parity
	- table creation instantiates routes and rpc methods
	- `transactional` adds routes and rpc methods
	- REST routes and RPC both invoke the `_runner._invoke()`
- Automated Request and Response schemas
- Default operations: create, read, update, delete, list, clear
- Extended operations: replace (put), bulk create/delete/update
- 6 Phase Hook Lifecycle
- Transactionals
- Table level configurations: __autoapi_nested_paths__, __autoapi_allow_anon__, & __autoapi_register_hooks__
- Column level configurations: info_schema ( disable_on, write_only, read_only, default_factory, examples, hybrid (hybrid properties), py_type)
- `_apply_row_filters` (deprecating)
- _RowBound hook providers
- phase-level hooks that can be wildcard or per-verb, per-model
- Automated route creation: rest paths or nested rest paths, rpc dispatch, healthz, methodz, hookz
- Support for AuthNProvider extensions


### Column-level configurations

The following `col.info["autoapi"]` keys are recognized by AutoAPI and related packages:

| Configuration key | Description & examples | Packages using it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `disable_on` | Excludes a field from specific verbs. The ApiKey digest hides the value on update and replace requests, and mixins such as `Ownable` and `TenantBound` add the same metadata when strict policies are chosen. Peagen's `Repository` model opts into these strict policies. | autoapi, peagen ORM |
| `write_only` | Marks a field so it can be written but never returned. Demonstrated in test models where a `secret` field is write-only. | autoapi (tests) |
| `read_only` | Keeps a field out of write verbs. Used for ApiKey digest and for GUID primary keys generated by `GUIDPk` (read-only on create). Auto-authn models inherit `GUIDPk`, so they inherit this metadata. | autoapi, auto-authn, peagen ORM |
| `default_factory` | Supplies a callable to generate default values. GUID primary keys use `uuid4` as a factory, and Peagen's `User` model exposes the same metadata. | autoapi, auto-authn, peagen ORM |
| `examples` | Provides example values for documentation or schema generation. Used widely in mixins (`tenant_id`, `user_id`, etc.) and explicitly in Peagen's `User.id` column. | autoapi, auto-authn, peagen ORM |
| `hybrid` | Enables hybrid properties in the schema. Demonstrated with a `full_name` hybrid property marked in tests. | autoapi (tests) |
| `py_type` | Specifies Python type for hybrids. Shown in tests where a computed field is declared as an `int`. | autoapi (tests) |
