"""
AutoAPI v3 â€“ Transport package.

Routers & helpers for exposing your API over JSON-RPC and REST.

Quick usage:
    from autoapi.v3.transport import (
        build_jsonrpc_router, mount_jsonrpc,
        build_rest_router,   mount_rest,
    )

    # JSON-RPC
    app.include_router(build_jsonrpc_router(api), prefix="/rpc")
    # or supply a DB dependency from an Engine or Provider:
    mount_jsonrpc(api, app, prefix="/rpc", engine=my_engine)

    # REST (aggregate all model routers under one prefix)
    # after you include models with mount_router=False
    app.include_router(build_rest_router(api, base_prefix="/api"))
    # or:
    mount_rest(api, app, base_prefix="/api")

    Build a JSON-RPC router for `api` and include it on the given FastAPI `app`
