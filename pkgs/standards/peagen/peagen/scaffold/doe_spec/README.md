## Editing guidelines

1. **Change factors** in `doe_spec.yml` â€“ keep snake-case keys.
2. Run `peagen validate doe-spec doe_spec.yml` to check schema + checksum.
3. Bump the **version** in `spec.yaml` when you publish a new design.
4. Never mutate a version that has already been used in production runs.
5. Put a patch under the factor if it depends on that factor alone; otherwise use
   the global `PATCHES` block.
