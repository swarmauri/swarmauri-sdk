## Editing guidelines

1. **Edit `doe_spec.yml`** to adjust factors or factor sets.
2. Ensure `version: v2` remains unchanged; older schemas are deprecated.
3. Run `peagen validate doe-spec doe_spec.yml` to check schema + checksum.
4. Bump the **version** in `spec.yaml` when you publish a new design.
5. Never mutate a version that has already been used in production runs.
