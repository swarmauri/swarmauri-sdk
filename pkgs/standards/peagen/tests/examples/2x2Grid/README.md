# 2x2Grid Example

This project demonstrates a minimal DOE specification with two factors,
each having two levels (A/B and C/D). The `grid` factor set generates
four runs: `AC`, `AD`, `BC`, and `BD`. Each factor level applies its
patch to `template_project.yaml`, producing patched artifacts in the
same directory.

Use the included `.peagen.toml` for local testing or adapt it for remote
execution.
