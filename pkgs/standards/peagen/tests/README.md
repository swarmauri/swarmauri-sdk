# Peagen Test Suite

This directory holds all automated tests for the **peagen** package. The tests are grouped by purpose so contributors can run only what they need.

| Subfolder | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `unit`    | Isolated unit tests for individual modules |
| `smoke`   | Lightweight CLI and RPC tests that verify core flows |
| `infra`   | Minimal infrastructure tests exercising remote evolve demos |
| `perf`    | Benchmarks for queues, backends, gateway and other components |
| `examples`| Test fixtures and project templates used across the suite |

Each subdirectory contains a README with more detail.
