# Unit Tests

**Purpose**: exercise individual functions and classes in isolation.

**Description**: the bulk of Peagen's coverage lives here. Tests import modules directly and avoid network or file system side effects where possible.

**Goals**
- Ensure internal logic behaves as expected
- Catch regressions quickly with fast execution

**Non-goals**
- Testing full CLI workflows or external services
- Measuring performance
