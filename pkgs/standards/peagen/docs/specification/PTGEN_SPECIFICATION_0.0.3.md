# PTGEN_SPECIFICATION 0.0.3

---

## Introduction
The **PTGEN_SPECIFICATION 0.0.3** describes a structured approach for generating project files and source code from a declarative YAML specification. It is intended for tool authors, DevOps engineers, and developers looking to automate repetitive project scaffolding tasks. By defining a standardized schema and templating model, the PTGEN system allows teams to streamline boilerplate creation, maintain uniform project structures, and reduce development overhead.

PTGEN centers around four main artifacts:

1. `projects_payload.yaml` – The core configuration that describes a project’s overarching metadata, requirements, packages, and modules.  
2. `ptree.yaml.j2` – A Jinja-based template that iterates over the payload to produce a structured set of file definitions. These definitions determine how, where, and in what form each file in the project is generated or copied.  
3. `agent_default.j2` – The default file template, consuming the final file-level context to output code and documentation aligned with the specified project requirements and style guidelines.  
4. `*.*.j2` files – *(Placeholder for additional, specialized templates.)*

By combining these four components, PTGEN enables the automated generation of consistent, well-structured codebases that adhere to user-defined requirements and best practices.

---

## Scope
This specification focuses on the following key elements:

- **Schema Definitions**: Lays out the required and optional fields within each of the three core PTGEN artifacts. It also provides guidelines for how individual fields should be interpreted or transformed.  
- **Template Contexts**: Explains the hierarchical context model—project, package, module, and file-level data—and how those contexts are passed among various templates.  
- **Generation Mechanics**: Describes how PTGEN processes the YAML payload and Jinja templates to produce or modify files.

**Outside of scope** are the following areas:

- **Implementation Details** of the template engine runtime, such as the specific version of Jinja or Python.  
- **Deployment** or integration processes for PTGEN in CI/CD environments.  
- **Extended Customization** of advanced logic like post-processing scripts, plugin-based transformations, or dynamic user input that might occur after file generation.

## Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- **PTGEN**: An acronym for **Project Template Generation**, referring to the overall mechanism or system that automates project scaffolding based on YAML specifications and Jinja templates.  
- **PTREE**: Shorthand for **Project Tree**, used to describe a structured index of files and folders in a generated project. It also refers to the `ptree.yaml.j2` template that orchestrates file generation.  
- **YAML**: Stands for **YAML Ain’t Markup Language**, a human-friendly data serialization format used for the `projects_payload.yaml` configuration file.  
- **Jinja**: A Python-based templating engine that processes template files (e.g., `agent_default.j2`) using context from YAML inputs to render final artifacts.  
- **Project Context**: The highest-level context in PTGEN, derived from the top-level information in `projects_payload.yaml` (e.g., `project_name`, `project_root`, etc.).  
- **Package Context**: A context object generated for each package within the project, containing package-specific metadata (name, authors, purpose, etc.).  
- **Module Context**: A context object generated for each module in a package, capturing module-specific metadata (name, description, dependencies, etc.).  
- **File Context**: Context data that describes an individual file to be generated, including file-specific purpose, requirements, and dependencies. Produced by combining the higher-level contexts in the `ptree.yaml.j2` template.  
- **PEP 8**: The **Python Enhancement Proposal** that defines style conventions for Python code, including formatting, naming standards, and whitespace usage.  
- **PEP 420**: The **Python Enhancement Proposal** introducing implicit namespace packages. This allows a single import namespace to be split across multiple directories without requiring an `__init__.py`.  
- **PEP 484**: The **Python Enhancement Proposal** introducing optional type hints and annotations to improve code clarity and tooling support.  
- **CI/CD**: **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment**, a software development practice that automates building, testing, and deploying code.  
- **Spec (or Specification)**: This PTGEN document, outlining structure, formatting, and behavioral rules for the PTGEN ecosystem.
- **The Generation Tool**: A conceptual label describing the overarching software or workflow that orchestrates PTGEN’s steps or a similar code-generation approach.  
- **The Processor**: A conceptual label for the component that merges context objects (derived from the YAML input) with the PTGEN rules (e.g., `ptree.yaml.j2`) to produce file definitions or records.
- **The Templating Engine**: A conceptual label for any system that merges final context data with templates (such as `agent_default.j2` or other Jinja-based files) to render or generate the final project artifacts.

| `RENDERED_FILE_NAME`  | string          | Required | The destination path for the rendered file (e.g., `{{ PROJECT_ROOT }}/{{ PKG.NAME }}/LICENSE`).                                                        |
| `PROCESS_TYPE`        | enum            | Required | Determines how the file is handled:<br> - `COPY`: Copy the file directly, no additional rendering.<br> - `GENERATE`: Render the file as a Jinja template.<br> - `SCRIPT`: A special process type for scripts or custom logic. |
| `AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` | string        | Required | Points to the Jinja template (e.g., `agent_default.j2`) used to process this file.                                                                      |

**Contexts Used and Produced:**  
- **Project, Package, and Module Contexts** from **projects_payload.yaml** are each read in sequence.  
- For each context, the template generates file records describing how to construct or render each file.  
- **File Context (FIL_CTX)**: A refined context for each generated file, including the file’s purpose, description, dependencies, etc.

- **Package Context, Module Context, and File Context** generated within **ptree.yaml.j2**. These contexts are merged into one final Jinja environment to produce the ultimate content for each file.

### 4.4. **File Templates**
🚧

### 4.5. **Context Production and Consumption Summary**

- **projects_payload.yaml**  
  Produces **Project Context**, **Package Context**, and **Module Context** used by subsequent templates.

- **ptree.yaml.j2**  
  Consumes the above contexts and produces a list of **File Context** records (one for each file).

- **agent_default.j2**  
  Consumes the final **File Context** and any higher-level context to render or generate the final file output.

Each step in the pipeline expands or refines context data, which drives the final rendered files.

### 5. **Conceptual Generation Mechanics**

## 5.1 Process Flow
### Initial Input Parsing

The generation tool begins by loading and validating the YAML configuration (e.g., projects_payload.yaml).
Required fields (such as project_name, packages[].name, etc.) are checked. If any are missing or invalid, the system issues a validation error. Optional fields may default to placeholder values or simply be omitted.

### Context Construction

From the parsed data, the processor builds multiple layers of context in a hierarchical manner:
Project Context: Summarizes top-level metadata (e.g., project_name, project_root).
Package Context: One for each package, detailing its purpose, authors, and relevant attributes.
Module Context: One for each module, capturing details like description, requirements, and dependencies.
File Context: An additional context relevant to individual files as defined in the next steps. This can include file-specific purpose, description, or other file-oriented requirements.

### File Record Generation

The transformation pipeline then applies a template definition file (often ptree.yaml.j2) to create a list of file records.
Each record specifies:
How a particular file is produced (copied, generated, or run through a script).
The File Context for that file (combining relevant data from the Project/Package/Module contexts, plus any file-specific attributes defined in FILE_CTX).

### Rendering or Copying Files

For file records, the templating engine merges the corresponding File Context with a template (e.g., agent_default.j2) if PROCESS_TYPE is GENERATE.
If PROCESS_TYPE is COPY, the source file is transferred as-is.
If PROCESS_TYPE is SCRIPT, a user-defined script runs to handle the file in a custom manner (such as further transformation, post-processing, or retrieval from an external source).
Output Structure

The processor places all resulting files into their designated locations based on each record’s RENDERED_FILE_NAME.
An optional verification step can confirm that files meet style guidelines, contain required docstrings, or follow naming conventions.

## 5.2 Rationale for a Conceptual Approach
Implementation Agnosticism: By referring to “the generation tool,” “the processor,” or “the templating engine,” we avoid mandating specific programming languages, library versions, or runtime frameworks.
Clarity of Data Flow: Emphasizing separate contexts (Project, Package, Module, and File) demonstrates how information from the YAML input cascades down to individual files.
Extensibility: New modules or packages can be added by simply expanding the YAML specification. The pipeline remains consistent—only the data changes.
Common Ground for Implementers: Teams can adopt any supporting frameworks or libraries they prefer, as long as the fundamental contract (YAML input → contexts → file records → final files) remains intact.

## Roles and Responsibilities

In order to maintain a clear process for updating and using the **PTGEN_SPECIFICATION 0.0.3**, the following roles and their associated responsibilities are defined:

### Specification Owner

- Oversees the overall direction, completeness, and accuracy of the PTGEN specification.  
- Approves major changes and version increments.  
- Ensures alignment of updates with overarching organizational or community goals.

### Maintainers

- Manage the day-to-day upkeep of the specification, including minor fixes, clarifications, and editorial improvements.  
- Incorporate feedback from contributors and end users.  
- Handle version control, merge requests, and documentation of revisions (e.g., updating the Revision History).

### Contributors

- Propose changes, improvements, or clarifications to the specification.  
- Provide feedback on new features, schema revisions, or clarifications.  
- Adhere to established guidelines for submitting pull requests, issues, or discussion threads.

### Implementers

- Use the PTGEN specification to create or generate projects, packages, and modules.  
- Report issues or ambiguities in the specification.  
- Offer suggestions to improve usability, clarity, or compliance with actual project needs.

### Reviewers

- Provide quality checks on proposed changes.  
- Ensure that new or modified elements remain consistent with the established scope and style of the specification.  
- Verify that all updates adhere to the relevant standards (PEP 8, PEP 420, PEP 484, etc.).

## Compliance and Conformance

To ensure consistent project generation and alignment with the **PTGEN_SPECIFICATION 0.0.3**, any implementation of PTGEN should meet the following conformance criteria:

1. **Schema Adherence**  
   - **Required Fields**: All required fields in the `projects_payload.yaml` (e.g., `project_name`, `packages[].name`, `modules[].name`) must be present and correctly typed.  
   - **Optional Fields**: Optional fields, if used, must follow the specified format. For instance, `packages[].package_requires` must be a list of dependency objects with valid `NAME` and `VERSION` properties.

2. **Template Integrity**  
   - **ptree.yaml.j2 Generation**: The file definitions produced by iterating over the `projects_payload.yaml` must correctly reflect the input data. Missing or superfluous file definitions indicate non-compliance.  
   - **agent_default.j2 Output**: Generated files should adhere to the style guidelines (PEP 8, PEP 420, PEP 484) and incorporate the specified docstrings, logging, and function signatures.

3. **Context Handling**  
   - **Project, Package, Module, and File Context**: Implementations must correctly assemble and pass contexts through the generation pipeline. Each context should correctly represent its related entity (e.g., package context for each package, module context for each module, etc.).

4. **Error Handling**  
   - **Validation**: Implementations must gracefully handle invalid or incomplete `projects_payload.yaml` inputs by reporting errors or warnings.  
   - **Fallback Mechanisms**: Where partial data is present, the generator should either provide defaults (if documented) or halt and notify the user with a clear message.

5. **Continuous Verification**  
   - **Automated Testing**: Projects generated using this specification should, where possible, include or pass unit tests confirming that the structure matches PTGEN norms (e.g., presence of a `tests` folder, adherence to naming conventions, etc.).

Implementations satisfying these criteria can claim **conformance** with PTGEN_SPECIFICATION 0.0.3. Third-party verifications or self-audits may reference the criteria above to ensure consistent and reliable usage of the specification.
