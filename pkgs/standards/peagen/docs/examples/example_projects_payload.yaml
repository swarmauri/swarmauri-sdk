          AUTHORS:
            - "Jacob Stewart"
          PURPOSE: "Implement session-based context management for robust conversational continuity."
          DESCRIPTION: "Maintains long-lived session context, ensuring consistent tracking of user data and topics across dialogue turns."
          REQUIREMENTS:
            - "Handle session persistence with fallback to a robust data store if in-memory caching becomes too large."
            - "Support concurrency at scale (i.e., safe to read/write from multiple threads)."
            - "Allow session expiration and renewal policies to adapt to production needs."

        MODULES:
          - NAME: "SessionContextConv"
            EXTRAS:
              PURPOSE: "Maintain and update per-session conversation context."
              DESCRIPTION: "Tracks conversation history within a session, leveraging concurrency-safe data structures for reliable context retrieval."
              REQUIREMENTS:
              - "Implement session retrieval and update methods with locks or atomic operations to prevent race conditions."
              - "Avoid duplicating conversation logs; instead, merge incremental user turns into a centralized store."
              - "Allow developers to configure session size limits, with clear error-handling or trimming mechanisms when limits are reached."
