poetry_ops.py

Provides functions to:
  - Install Poetry
  - Run 'poetry lock' and 'poetry install'
  - Extract path dependencies from pyproject.toml
  - Recursively build packages (based on the dependencies)
  - Show the installed packages (via pip freeze)
  - Set versions and dependency versions in pyproject.toml files
  - Publish built packages to PyPI
  - Publish packages based on path dependencies

Intended for use in a unified monorepo management CLI.
