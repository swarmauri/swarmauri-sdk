class IChain(ABC):
    """
    Defines the interface for a Chain within a system, facilitating the organized
    execution of a sequence of tasks or operations. This interface is at the core of
    orchestrating operations that require coordination between multiple steps, potentially
    involving decision-making, branching, and conditional execution based on the outcomes
    of previous steps or external data.

    A chain can be thought of as a workflow or pipeline, where each step in the chain can
    perform an operation, transform data, or make decisions that influence the flow of
    execution.

    Implementors of this interface are responsible for managing the execution order,
    data flow between steps, and any dynamic adjustments to the execution based on
    runtime conditions.

    Methods:
        add_step: Adds a step to the chain.
        remove_step: Removes a step from the chain.
        execute: Executes the chain, potentially returning a result.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def add_step(self, step: IChainStep, **kwargs) -> None:
        """
        Adds a new step to the chain. Steps are executed in the order they are added.
        Each step is represented by a Callable, which can be a function or method, with
        optional keyword arguments that specify execution aspects or data needed by the step.

        Parameters:
            step (IChainStep): The Callable representing the step to add to the chain.
            **kwargs: Optional keyword arguments that provide additional data or configuration
                      for the step when it is executed.
        """
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def remove_step(self, step: IChainStep) -> None:
        """
        Removes an existing step from the chain. This alters the chain's execution sequence
        by excluding the specified step from subsequent executions of the chain.

        Parameters:
            step (IChainStep): The Callable representing the step to remove from the chain.

    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Initiates the execution of the chain. This involves invoking each step in the order
        they have been added to the chain, passing control from one step to the next, and optionally
        aggregating or transforming results along the way.

        The execution process can incorporate branching, looping, or conditional logic based on the
        implementation, allowing for complex workflows to be represented and managed within the chain.

        Parameters:
            *args: Positional arguments passed to the first step in the chain. These can be data inputs
                   or other values required for the chain's execution.
            **kwargs: Keyword arguments that provide additional context, data inputs, or configuration
                      for the chain's execution. These can be passed to individual steps or influence
                      the execution flow of the chain.

        Returns:
            Any: The outcome of executing the chain. This could be a value produced by the final
                 step, a collection of outputs from multiple steps, or any other result type as
                 determined by the specific chain implementation.
