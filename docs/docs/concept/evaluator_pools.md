# Evaluator Pool Implementation Options

This document explores different strategies for implementing evaluator pools in Swarmauri. Evaluator pools manage collections of evaluators and coordinate their execution.

## Local Evaluator Pool

A local pool runs all evaluators within the same process using threading or asynchronous execution. This approach has minimal overhead and is ideal for testing or small scale deployments.

- Pros: simple setup, no extra dependencies
- Cons: limited isolation, constrained by local resources

## Service-Based Pool

Evaluator pools can be exposed as a network service. Each evaluation request is sent via an API (HTTP, gRPC, etc.). This allows multiple clients to share a common pool and makes scaling easier.

- Pros: language agnostic, decoupled from callers
- Cons: requires service orchestration and reliable networking

## Pub/Sub Architecture

Using a pub/sub system decouples evaluators from the scheduler. Programs are published as messages and workers subscribe to evaluation tasks. This model scales horizontally and is resilient to worker failures.

- Pros: highly scalable, flexible worker allocation
- Cons: increased complexity and external dependencies (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ, or cloud pub/sub services)

## Docker Container Pool

A pool may launch evaluators inside local Docker containers. Containers provide strong isolation and reproducible environments without requiring full orchestration tools.

- Pros: environment isolation, consistent dependencies
- Cons: extra overhead compared to direct execution, requires Docker engine

## Kubernetes-Based Pool

For large scale deployments, evaluator pools can be managed by Kubernetes. Each evaluator runs in its own pod, and the pool controller schedules jobs using Kubernetes APIs. This approach offers advanced scaling and fault tolerance features.

- Pros: powerful orchestration and monitoring
- Cons: highest operational complexity, depends on a Kubernetes cluster
